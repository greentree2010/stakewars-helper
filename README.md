| Welcome to Stakewars, a next-generation smart contract platform with high throughput, low latency, and an asset-oriented programming model powered by the [Move programming language](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move)! Find everything you need within the [Sui Developer Guides](doc/src/learn/index.md) and supporting materials below.      | <img src="doc/static/Sui_Icon_Brand.png" alt="sui_icon" width="200"/>      |
| Welcome to Stake Wars: Episode III A New Validator. Stake Wars is a program that helps the community become familiar with what it means to be a NEAR validator, and gives the community an early chance to access the chunk-only producer. Stake Wars offers rewards that support new members who want to join mainnet as a validator starting from the end of September 2022. I hope this document will be with you! | <img src="doc/static/Sui_Icon_Brand.png" alt="sui_icon" width="200"/>      |

### Highlights

Sui offers:

* Unmatched scalability, instant settlement
* A safe smart contract language accessible to mainstream developers
* Ability to define rich and composable on-chain assets
* Better user experience for web3 apps

Sui is the only blockchain today that can scale with the growth of web3 while achieving industry-leading performance, cost, programmability, and usability. As we push towards mainnet launch, we will demonstrate capacity beyond the transaction processing capabilities of established systems â€“ traditional and blockchain alike. We see Sui as the first internet-scale programmable blockchain platform, a foundational layer for web3.
